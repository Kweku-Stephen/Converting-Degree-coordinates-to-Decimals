# Converting-Degree-coordinates-to-Decimals
This was specifically designed for an uncertain group of elements within the data to run the computation on.
So instead of the main function of this body of code to accept a vector of length > 1, it onlyaccepts a vector of length 1 since some elements within the data for the 
conversion may not have been recorded or entered correctly ie. deviates from this structure " N9Â°23'17.3256'' "
